### Context-links

Used to move forum links such as *Character Sheet*, *See All Posts* and *Ignore* in the `.post-character` (and only be shown when hovering) but that moved when hovering, which was very disgraceful.
The only solution would've been to show it everytime (not pretty) or to set `height: 270px` (even less).
